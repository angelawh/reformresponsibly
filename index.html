								<h4>What we want you to know</h4>
								<p>Reduced standard penalty translates to standard leniency. We recognize the need for gradated penalty, so the sanction matches the severity of the violation; however, we do not think the solution is to lower penalty across the board. A student who writes 45-seconds overtime should not be penalized as severely as the student who Googles solutions on thier cellular phone.</p>

								<h4>What We Want You to Know</h4>
								<p>The Committee requires two pieces of evidence that a violation may have occurred to move a case to hearing. Codifying this norm is a great idea, but language matters. The word "indicates" forces the Chair to say whether a vioaltion occurred before a student ever has a chance to argue their case before the Committee.</p>

								<h4>The Referendum Text</h4>
								<p>Shall Article II, Section D of the Honor Constitution be amended to add that “a student will be found not responsible [of an Honor Code violation] if the Committee fails to find overwhelmingly convincing evidence that the student ought reasonably to have understood that their actions were in violation of the Honor Code, or if the course instructor explicitly states that a student’s actions were not in violation of their class policy"?</p>

								<h4>What we want you to know</h4>
								<p>As students, we are unified by our affiliation to the University and our acceptance of the Code upon matriculation. The same is not true for professors and preceptors, who may have been educated at different undergraduate institutions and have different notions of what constitutes academic integrity. Allowing a professor to determine a student's outcome at hearing undermines a system for student-to-student accountability.</p>
