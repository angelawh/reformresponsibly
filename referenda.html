						<h2 style="text-align:center">Referendum 1</h2>
						<p>This referendum only changes standard penalty for Honor Code violations, which are attempts to gain an unfair advantage on in-class examinations. Standard penalty for all other academic violations at the University, such as plagiarism on computer science assignments, will still be a one-year suspension.</p>
						<p>Rather than unilaterally and drastically changing standard penalty, we should table this issue and negotiate for a penalty system with gradation during the Spring 2018 semester.</p>

					<section id='referendum_2'>
						<h2 style="text-align:center">Referendum 2</h2>
						<p>While the evidentiary standard for two pieces of evidence isn't codified in the current Honor Code Constitution, it's a strong working norm for the Honor Committee. The Chair and Clerk of the Committee are not opposed to codify these norms; however, the language with which the USG Academics Subcommittee on the Honor Constitution uses to codify the norm is problematic.</p>

						<p>Our constitution is closely read and interpreted by the Committee, students in question, and administrators evaluating student appeals. We have a responsibility to all involved parties to ensure changes we make to the Constitution do not generate bias or procedural concerns.</p>

						<p>We are committed to working with the USG Senate in January to pass an internal amendment to the Honor Constitution to codify the standard with sound language.</p>
					</section>

					<hr class="major"/>
					<section id='referendum_3'>
						<h2 style="text-align:center" >Referendum 3</h2>
						<p>While the policy will almost certainly benefit some students, it will be at the cost of other students who committed fundamentally similar violations of the Code but did not benefit from what is, in effect, a professor veto.</p>

						<p>The Committee must honor precedents across cases to be consistent in its penalties, and this consistency lends itself to transparency about what students can and cannot do under the Code.</p>

					</section>
					<hr class="major"/>
					<section id='referendum_4'>
						<h2 style="text-align:center" >Referendum 4</h2>
						<p>In the status quo, the Honor Committee attempts to call all students irrespective of their status. We ask students to come to the Honor Committee Office, with the promise they will be notified of their status immediately upon arrival. The typical student knows of their status as a witness or a student in question within forty-five minutes of their first interaction with the Committee.</p>

						<p>Finally, we privilege confidentiality. When we do not control the environment in which a student learns they are under investigation, we cannot control who is with a student when they learn they are under investigation. A student should have the right to communicate their status only to members of the community to whom they are ready to disclose the information.</p>
